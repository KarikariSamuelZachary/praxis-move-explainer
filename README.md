# Praxis AI-Powered Chess Learning App

Praxis is a chess improvement app focused on **understanding, not just playing**.

Instead of showing engine numbers and "best moves" with no context, Praxis explains **why** a move was good or bad in plain English and helps players stop repeating the same mistakes through structured repetition.

---

## Problem

Most chess platforms:
- Rely heavily on engine evaluations
- Assume players already understand chess concepts
- Tell you **what** the best move is, but not **why**

**As a result:**
- Players repeat the same mistakes
- Learning is shallow
- Improvement is slow and frustrating

---

## Solution

Praxis acts like a **human chess coach**:
1. Reviews your games
2. Identifies critical mistakes
3. Explains each mistake in natural language using an LLM
4. Reinforces learning through repetition using the **Woodpecker Method**

This makes Praxis a **training system**, not just a game analyzer.

## Core Learning Loop (MVP)

1. User uploads a completed chess game (PGN)
2. The system identifies **up to 3 critical mistakes**
3. Each mistake is explained in plain English:
   - What the player was trying to do
   - Why it failed
   - The underlying chess concept involved
4. Each mistake becomes a **training item**
5. The same position is resurfaced later for repetition
6. If the user understands the mistake better over time, learning is happening.

### Game Review
- Upload a PGN
- Analyze one game at a time

### AI Move Explanations
- Natural-language explanations generated by an LLM
- Focus on concepts not engine lines
- No eval bars or best move spam

### Mistake Cards
Each critical mistake is stored as a reusable training item containing:
- Board position (FEN)
- Mistake category (e.g. king safety, loose pieces)
- Explanation text

### Woodpecker Method Training
- Repeated exposure to past mistakes
- Fixed repetition intervals (e.g. 1 day, 3 days, 7 days)

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)

- Multiplayer or live games
- Ratings or Elo tracking
- Opening explorer

- Leaderboards
- Accuracy percentages

**Praxis is not trying to replace Chess.com or Lichess — it complements them.**

---

## Success Criteria

The MVP is successful if users say things like:
- *"I finally understand why that move was bad."*
- *"I keep making this mistake — and now I see it."*
- *"I stopped repeating this error after a few sessions."*

**Learning > metrics.**

---

## Tech Direction (High-Level)

- **Chess Engine**: Used only to detect critical moments
- **LLM**: Generates human-style explanations
- **Frontend**: Minimal, focused on reading and training
- **Backend**: Stores games, mistakes,and repetition schedule

## Monetization (Future)

Praxis is designed to be monetized through:
- Subscriptions

Monetization is intentional not an afterthought.
